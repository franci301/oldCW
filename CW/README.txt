LEVEL ONE

My code demonstrates inheritance in the following way...

I have a superclass called [Insert name of superclass here]

This superclass is extended into at least two subclasses called [Insert names of the subclasses here] 

For each of the named subclasses complete the following...

Subclass 1.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]

Subclass 2.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]


LEVEL TWO

Polymorphism consists of the use of the Substitution principle and Late Dynamic binding.

In my code, polymorphism is implemented in at least two placesâ€¦

Example 1.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [class name and line number where substitution is used]. The name of the superclass used in this example is [name of superclass] and the subclasses used are [names of subclasses].

Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class name and line number].

[Explain briefly (no more than four sentences), why this example of polymorphism is necessary in your code.]

Example 2.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [class name and line number where substitution is used]. The name of the superclass used in this example is [name of superclass] and the subclasses used are [names of subclasses].
	
Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class name and line number].
